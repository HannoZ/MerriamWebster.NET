          "You may not think of your education as relaxation, but, believe it or not, the word {it}school{/it} can be traced back to a Greek word meaning “leisure.” Ancient Greek {it}scholē{/it}, “rest, leisure,” came to be applied to the philosophical discussions in which the best of Greek society spent their free time (of which they had a great deal, since slaves did most of the real work). The meaning of {it}scholē{/it} was extended to the groups who listened to a particular philosopher, and later to the set of beliefs held by such a group. When Latin {it}schola{/it} was borrowed from Greek, the emphasis fell more on the place where a philosopher spoke, and it is the sense “place of instruction” that was ultimately passed to English."
